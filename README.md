#📊 Task 10: Python EDA – Summary & Outlier Detection
📌 Overview

This task focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to understand the dataset, identify patterns, detect outliers, and prepare a clean dataset for further analysis.

🛠 Tools Used

Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

📂 Dataset

Students Performance dataset (CSV format)

✅ What I Did

Loaded the dataset and checked its structure using .head(), .info(), and .shape

Generated descriptive statistics using .describe()

Checked missing values and calculated their percentage

Visualized data using histograms and boxplots

Detected outliers using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method

Created an outlier flag column

Removed outlier rows to clean the dataset

Analyzed relationships using a correlation matrix

Exported the cleaned dataset to a CSV file
